# tjdashboard [Beta]
> process representation for TJBot

This app displays a dashboard that attempts to show how the processes that occur on tjbot behind the scenes.
In addition, it also provides UI buttons that can be used to control the bot e.g. control the LED color, make your bot look around and describe what it sees, wave its arm etc.
